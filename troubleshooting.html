<h1>SNIK Graph Troubleshooting</h1>
<img src="img/graph.png" class="helpimage"/>
<h2>"Javascript is off."</h2>
SNIK Graph does not work without JavaScript.
Please ensure that JavaScript <a href="http://enable-javascript.com/">is enabled</a>.

<h2>Some features are not working or are not displayed correctly</h2>
SNIK Graph uses some features of ECMAScript 6, so please ensure that your browser is up to date.
For example at least Firefox 48, Microsoft Edge 14 or Chrome 52 should work. Internet Explorer is discontinued and thus not supported.
If you still encounter errors, <a href="#bugreport">please submit a bug report</a>.

<h2>Book excerpts</h2>
The SNIK ontology is extracted from several textbooks.
For "Health Information Systems" (the blue nodes) and "IT-Projektmanagement im Gesundheitswesen" (German, the orange nodes), PDFs are available internally.

<h3>"no book page defined"</h3>
Either there is no PDF available for that textbook or the textbook page is missing for that concept.

<h3>The book excerpts are not accessible</h3>
Unfortunately, the textbooks are not open source and are only accessible for IMISE members.

<h3>The book excerpts are not openened at the right page</h3>
If the book is opened at page 1, you need to make sure that the file is not downloaded but opened directly in the browser.
If the book is openened at a later, but incorrect, page, please <a href="https://github.com/IMISE/snik-ontology/issues">submit an ontology ticket</a>.

<h2>Mobile</h2>
SNIK Graph is not optimized for Smartphones and Tablets, as such both the controls and performance may be unsatisfactory.
Feel free to <a href="contribute.html">contribute</a> if you want to improve that.

<h2>Submit a Bug Report</h2>
If you encounter a technical problems that is not adressed here,
please <a href="https://github.com/IMISE/snik-cytoscape.js/issues">view the list of known issues</a>
and if it is not listed there, <a href="https://github.com/IMISE/snik-cytoscape.js/issues/new">submit a bug report</a>.
Always state your browser name, version and operating system, such as "Firefox 50.0.2, openSUSE Leap".

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
SNIK Graph is a research prototype developed part-time by a single researcher who is not a JavaScript expert and as such does not undergo the extensive testing and development of big projects.
As such, <a href="contribute.html">contributions</a> and suggestions are always appreciated,
However, HTML 5 and ECMAScript 6 are used by choice and we will not approve changes that compromise the clarity or size of the source code by adding compatibility layers for outdated browser versions.
